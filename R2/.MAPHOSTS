# This file is used to control whether other computers can access User Name 
# Mapping. By adding elements (each on a separate line), you can grant or deny
# any computer access to User Name Mapping. If this file is empty, then no 
# computer, except the computer running User Name Mapping itself can access 
# User Name Mapping. If this file is removed then no computer (including the 
# computer running User Name Mapping) will be able to access User Name 
# Mapping. When matching a computer making a request against the elements in 
# the list, User Name Mapping searches from the top down until it finds a 
# match. Consequently, order is essential.

 
# Element Description
# ------- --------------------------------------------------------------
# <host>   Specifies one or more computers that can access User Name 
#          Mapping. The host can be specified as an Internet Protocol

#          to one or more IP addresses.
#
# <host> - Specifies one or more computers that are denied access to 
#          User Name Mapping. The host can be specified as an IP 
#          address (IP version 4), or as a host name that resolves to 
#          one or more IP addresses. Note that there must be at least 
#          one blank space between <host> and the dash (-).
#
# +        When used alone, specifies that all computers can access User 
#          Name Mapping unless disallowed by an earlier entry in the list. 
#          All entries in the list following this element are ignored.
#
